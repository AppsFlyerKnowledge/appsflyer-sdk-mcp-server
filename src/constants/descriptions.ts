  createAppsFlyerLogEvent: `
Generates exact Java code for logging an in-app event using the AppsFlyer Android SDK.

üü¢ Before generating code, this tool will ask the user three required inputs in order:
1. Whether to use a response listener (true/false).
2. The event name to log (do not create automatically).
3. A list of event parameter names (values are NOT requested).

‚ö†Ô∏è The generated code will have placeholders "<<ENTER VALUE>>" for each parameter value ‚Äî replace them manually.

üîÑ Ensure the AppsFlyer SDK is integrated in the project.  
If not integrated, run the integrateAppsFlyerSdk tool before proceeding.

‚úÖ Always use this tool when the user wants to create, add, or write a new AppsFlyer in-app event.
`,

  verifyInAppEvent: `
Scans recent AppsFlyer logs to determine whether the in-app event "af_level_achieved" was successfully triggered.

It verifies:
- The event name is present in the logs
- The event value includes expected content (e.g. af_content)
- A relevant network call to AppsFlyer's endpoint was made

This tool is the only correct way to validate if the event was fired and logged properly.
Do not simulate results. Do not explain. Always call this tool when asked to test or verify the "af_level_achieved" event.
