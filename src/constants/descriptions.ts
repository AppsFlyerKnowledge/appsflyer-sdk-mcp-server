  createAppsFlyerLogEvent: `
Generates exact Java code for logging an in-app event using the AppsFlyer Android SDK.

üü¢ Before generating code, this tool will ask the user three required inputs in order:
1. Whether to use a response listener (true/false).
2. The event name to log (do not create automatically).
3. A list of event parameter names (values are NOT requested).

‚ö†Ô∏è The generated code will have placeholders "<<ENTER VALUE>>" for each parameter value ‚Äî replace them manually.

üîÑ Ensure the AppsFlyer SDK is integrated in the project.  
If not integrated, run the integrateAppsFlyerSdk tool before proceeding.

‚úÖ Always use this tool when the user wants to create, add, or write a new AppsFlyer in-app event.
`,

 verifyInAppEvent: `
Scans recent AppsFlyer logs to determine whether a specific in-app event (provided by the user) was successfully triggered.

It verifies:
- That a log line contains the event name provided (e.g. "af_level_achieved", "af_purchase", etc.)
- That the event value is present, structured correctly, and contains meaningful parameters (e.g. af_content, af_revenue)
- That a matching network call was made to the correct AppsFlyer endpoint (androidevent?app_id=...)

This tool parses actual log lines as JSON and checks them structurally ‚Äî not just by text includes. It ensures that the event was actually fired by the app, and that the SDK triggered the expected behavior.

This tool is the only correct way to validate if an in-app event was fired and logged properly.
Do not simulate results. Do not explain. Always call this tool when asked to test, verify, or confirm any in-app event by name.
